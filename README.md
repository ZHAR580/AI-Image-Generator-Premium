AI Studio Pro — Final Frontend Prototype
=======================================

What this ZIP contains
- index.html, style.css, script.js — frontend-only prototype that runs in any static server (or open index.html in browser).
- README explains UI sections and how to use the prototype.
- All generation features are placeholders (use placehold.co demo images or sample audio). Backend/Colab needed to perform actual image/TTS/video generation and zipping.

Sections & Features (where to find in UI)
1. Images (sidebar -> Images)
   - Prompt box, variations, size, model selector.
   - Generate button: creates placeholder images using placehold.co.
   - Use in Studio: sends image to Studio storyboard.
   - Download: downloads the image file.

2. Reference (sidebar -> Reference)
   - Upload a reference image (face or object) and set Strength/Style.
   - 'Generate from Reference' is a placeholder — backend required for conditioning (face transfer/inpainting).

3. Stores (sidebar -> Stores)
   - Manage multiple store presets, upload CSV of products, set prompt templates.
   - 'Generate Bulk' creates placeholder images per product and stores them in store gallery.
   - 'Download Manifest' downloads a JSON manifest that a backend/Colab can use to generate + zip real images for download.

4. Studio (sidebar -> Studio)
   - Paste a script/story and split into scenes (naive sentence split).
   - Each scene shows a placeholder image and text; you can regenerate when backend is connected.

5. Video Editor (sidebar -> Video Editor)
   - Manual timeline editor: import images, drag into timeline slots, reorder, set per-scene transition/duration.
   - Preview plays a simple slideshow with per-scene audio (if present).
   - Export (Colab) saves a video_manifest.json that a backend can use to stitch MP4 (ffmpeg) with transitions and audio.

6. Voice (sidebar -> Voice)
   - Inline TTS controls (model, style). Placeholder returns demo audio. Replace with Eleven/Coqui/Bark endpoints.

7. Settings (sidebar -> Settings)
   - Global model selection, size, steps, CFG scale, safe mode toggle, output format.
   - These values are included when exporting manifests/projects.

Download & Deploy
- Save the folder and upload to GitHub Pages (or any static host).
- To enable real AI image/TTS/video, create a Colab notebook or server to accept the manifests (JSON) and run Stable Diffusion + TTS + ffmpeg to generate final assets, then return a zip or final MP4.

Next steps I can do (pick one)
- Build the Colab notebook to accept project/manifest and generate images + zip them for download.
- Add client-side zipping (JSZip) — works but may be slow/limited by browser memory.
- Integrate real TTS endpoints and show how to connect them.

Files in this ZIP
- index.html — main frontend
- style.css — styles
- script.js — JS behavior and placeholders
- README.md — this file

How to run
- Unzip and open index.html in your browser OR host the folder on GitHub Pages.

- If you want, I can now build the Colab backend that reads the manifest and produces real images & MP4. Say 'Make Colab notebook' to get it next.
